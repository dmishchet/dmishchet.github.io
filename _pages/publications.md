          The increasing globalization of higher education has sparked debates about the impact of international student presence on natives. This paper provides the first evidence on the impact of exposure to international students on the long-term outcomes of native students. I combine unique survey and administrative data from the Netherlands covering one million students across three decades. My identification strategy relies on idiosyncratic variation in the share of international students within university programs over time. I find that exposure to international students leads native students to <i>(i)</i> form more social ties with non-natives, <i>(ii)</i> hold more positive attitudes towards migration and learning about other cultures, and <i>(iii)</i> seek opportunities abroad. Notably, I find precisely estimated zero effects on employment, income, entrepreneurship, and the share of foreign-born co-workers up to 25 years after university entry. These findings suggest that exposure to international students makes natives more culturally open and internationally oriented, without compromising their local economic success.

      The article examines the application of the public policy clause to debtors linked to the Russian Federation. It identifies two main types of connections: the debtor being a strategic state enterprise, and the state being the ultimate beneficiary of the debtor. The author notes that when evaluating the connection between the debtor and the state, Russian courts often fail to consider legal mechanisms designed to protect state interests, which influences their judicial decisions. By analyzing Russian legislation and comparing it with international practices from France, China, and Ukraine, the author argues that a connection between the debtor and the state should not automatically justify the application of the public policy clause.

      The study explores the case law of Russian arbitrazh (commercial) courts in enforcing foreign arbitral awards. The first part of the study delves into the legal regulations governing these relationships, assesses the outcomes of claims submitted to arbitrazh courts, and discusses the timelines for their resolution. It also identifies the preferred countries for arbitration according to Russian parties. The second part focuses on the public policy exception, examining its role and significance through case law and legal doctrine. The study highlights instances where courts have incorrectly interpreted this exception, in effect re-evaluating cases on merits. Although Russian courts implement interim measures on the assets of Russian debtors at foreign arbitration institutions – seemingly to ensure timely enforcement of decisions – this intended facilitation does not typically materialize.
