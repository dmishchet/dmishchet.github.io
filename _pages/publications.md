My research interests lie in the field of empirical microeconomics, with a focus on the economics of education, labor, and health. To estimate the impact of policy reforms in these areas, I use quasi-experimental methods that leverage administrative and survey data. This approach allows me to gain insights into the effects of policy changes in real-world settings, and to identify the causal mechanisms behind these effects. By studying these important areas of economics, I hope to contribute to the development of evidence-based policies that can improve outcomes for individuals and society as a whole.

The Bologna reform, the largest European education reform, was implemented in Russia in 2011. The reform shortened the duration of some undergraduate programs by one year and compressed their curricula. Using a difference–in–differences design, I find that the reform had no short– or medium–term adverse effects on employment. Further, I find that null average effects on wages mask considerable heterogeneity: while female graduates’ wages remained unaffected, male graduates experienced a wage decline. To explain these findings, I propose a novel model of students’ decision–making that predicts students with high (low) relative returns to education compared to returns to working would invest more (less) time in studying. Consistent with the model, I find that female students with high relative returns studied more intensively, optimally investing in their human capital and securing stable wages. In contrast, male students with low relative returns underinvested in their human capital, leading to a decline in wages. These intriguing findings shed light on the heterogeneous impact of educational reforms and the role of students’ decision–making in shaping labor market outcomes, inviting further exploration of similar reforms across different contexts.

      <summary> Abstract </summary>
      <p align="justify">  
Although geographical distance has become less relevant in co–authorship for monodisciplinary fields such as economics, mathematics, and physics, little is known about international collaboration in multidisciplinary fields such as higher education. This paper studies collaboration patterns in higher education research using the Scopus database with the application of the gravity model. The results show that the intensity of collaboration is negatively associated with geographical distance and positively associated with linguistic commonality but these findings differ significantly between various world regions. European scholars appear to give preference to linguistically proximate partners over geographical neighbours. Although English is the lingua franca in science, language is not a significant factor for the formation of collaboration for North American and Asian researchers. These findings have policy implications for fostering multidisciplinary research in international partnerships.
