          Rules only matter if they are enforced, and cross-border commerce rests on that principle. With the growing number of international conflicts, it is crucial to know whether this principle still holds in practice. We examine the effect of the 2014 annexation of Crimea on the enforcement rate of foreign decisions by Russian and Ukrainian judges. We assemble novel data on the entire universe of Russian and Ukrainian court decisions concerning the enforcement of foreign decisions resolving cross-border commercial disputes. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the enforcement rate of Ukrainian (Russian) decisions in Russia (Ukraine) fell by 26% (33%) after the annexation. These effects vary with judge ethnicity and court location. We identify two mechanisms driving these patterns: increased use of judicial discretion and disruptions in cross-border communication. Our findings provide the first causal evidence that international conflict affects both judicial decision-making and the enforcement of commercial treaties.

          We use a rigorous three-stage many-analysts design to assess how different researcher decisions—specifically data cleaning, research design, and the interpretation of a policy question—affect the variation in estimated treatment effects. A total of 146 research teams each completed the same causal inference task three times each: first with few constraints, then using a shared research design, and finally with pre-cleaned data in addition to a specified design. We find that even when analyzing the same data, teams reach different conclusions. In the first stage, the interquartile range (IQR) of the reported policy effect was 3.1 percentage points, with substantial outliers. Surprisingly, the second stage, which restricted research design choices, exhibited slightly higher IQR (4.0 percentage points), largely attributable to imperfect adherence to the prescribed protocol. By contrast, the final stage, featuring standardized data cleaning, narrowed variation in estimated effects, achieving an IQR of 2.4 percentage points. Reported sample sizes also displayed significant convergence under more restrictive conditions, with the IQR dropping from 295,187 in the first stage to 29,144 in the second, and effectively zero by the third. Our findings underscore the critical importance of data cleaning in shaping applied microeconomic results and highlight avenues for future replication efforts.

      The article examines the application of the public policy clause to debtors linked to the Russian Federation. It identifies two main types of connections: the debtor being a strategic state enterprise, and the state being the ultimate beneficiary of the debtor. The author notes that when evaluating the connection between the debtor and the state, Russian courts often fail to consider legal mechanisms designed to protect state interests, which influences their judicial decisions. By analyzing Russian legislation and comparing it with international practices from France, China, and Ukraine, the author argues that a connection between the debtor and the state should not automatically justify the application of the public policy clause.

      The study explores the case law of Russian arbitrazh (commercial) courts in enforcing foreign arbitral awards. The first part of the study delves into the legal regulations governing these relationships, assesses the outcomes of claims submitted to arbitrazh courts, and discusses the timelines for their resolution. It also identifies the preferred countries for arbitration according to Russian parties. The second part focuses on the public policy exception, examining its role and significance through case law and legal doctrine. The study highlights instances where courts have incorrectly interpreted this exception, in effect re-evaluating cases on merits. Although Russian courts implement interim measures on the assets of Russian debtors at foreign arbitration institutions – seemingly to ensure timely enforcement of decisions – this intended facilitation does not typically materialize.
